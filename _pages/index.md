## About me

Hi, I am Jack. <img src="/assets/images/hand-waving.gif" width="25px">

I'm a 3rd year undergrad students at University of California, San Diego, major in Data Science and minor in Mathematics. I'm passionate about turning complex data into insights through _collecting_, _processing_, _analyzing_, and _presenting_. I like exploring data from various domains, with an interest in data automation, predictive modeling, and data visualization. I'm also exploring agentic LLM and generative ai. 

I'm currently an instructional assistant for DSC 40B - [Theoretical Foundations of Data Science II](https://dsc40b.com/), where I help students navigate key theoretical concepts in data structure and algorithm.

I'm always eager to learn more about different industry. Iâ€™m actively seeking for an internship opportunity in data science, data analysts, data engineering, software engineering, ... to further develop my skills and contribute to impactful projects.

Thank you for visting my site and feel free to explore my projects.
