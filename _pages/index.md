## About me

Hi, I am Jack. <img src="/assets/images/hand-waving.gif" width="25px">

I'm a rising 4th year undergrad at University of California, San Diego, major in Data Science and minor in Mathematics. I'm passionate about turning complex data into insights through _collecting_, _processing_, _analyzing_, and _presenting_. I like exploring data from various domains, with an interest in data automation, predictive modeling, and data visualization. I'm also exploring agentic LLM and generative ai. 

I am an instructional assistant at HalÄ±cÄ±oÄŸlu Data Science Institute â€“ UC San Diego for DSC 190 - Statistical Data Analysis and Inference, DSC 40B - [Theoretical Foundations of Data Science II](https://dsc40b.com/), and DSC 80 - [Practice and Application of Data Science](https://dsc80.com/), where I help students navigate key theoretical concepts and practical applications in data science and statistics. I am also a Software Developer Intern at Green Optic Films, where I worked on a medical video analysis software for medical research.. 

I'm always eager to learn more about different industry. Iâ€™m actively seeking for internship opportunity in data science, data analysts, data engineering, software engineering, ... to further develop my skills and contribute to impactful projects.

Thank you for visting my site and feel free to explore my projects.
