## About me

Hi, I am Jack. <img src="/assets/images/hand-waving.gif" width="25px">

I'm a 3rd year undergrad students at University of California, San Diego, major in Data Science and minor in Mathematics. I'm passionate about turning complex data into insights through _collecting_, _processing_, _analyzing_, and _presenting_. I like exploring data from various domains, with an interest in data automation, predictive modeling, and data visualization. I'm also exploring agentic LLM and generative ai. 

I have worked as an instructional assistant for two data science courses at UC San Diego, DSC 190 - Statistical Data Analysis and Inference and DSC 40B - [Theoretical Foundations of Data Science II](https://dsc40b.com/), where I help students navigate key theoretical concepts in data science and statistics. Currently, I am a Python Developer Intern at Green Optic Films LLC, developing a data-driven application for medical research. 

I'm always eager to learn more about different industry. Iâ€™m actively seeking for a 2025 summer internship opportunity in data science, data analysts, data engineering, software engineering, ... to further develop my skills and contribute to impactful projects.

Thank you for visting my site and feel free to explore my projects.
